Brent Oil Price Forecasting Project
This project involves forecasting Brent oil prices using historical data and various analytical techniques. The analysis is conducted in a Jupyter Notebook environment, utilizing Python for data manipulation, visualization, and predictive modeling. Key components of the project include:

Data Loading and Preparation: The historical Brent oil prices dataset is loaded and processed using pandas, including parsing dates to ensure proper time series analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Initial data exploration involves visualizing the time series of Brent oil prices, identifying key patterns, and checking for trends and seasonality in the data.
Forecasting Model: Using advanced time series forecasting techniques, the model predicts future Brent oil prices based on historical trends. Techniques such as ARIMA, SARIMA, or machine learning models like XGBoost or LSTM may be employed to generate accurate forecasts.
Visualization: Graphical representations of the historical data and forecast results are included to provide an intuitive understanding of price movements over time.
The ultimate goal of this project is to deliver a reliable forecast that can aid in strategic decision-making for stakeholders involved in the oil and gas industry.
